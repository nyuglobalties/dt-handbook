The Data Team manages all TIES data using [Datalad](http://datalad.org), and all data are hosted [at this GIN repository](https://gin.g-node.org/nyuglobalties/data).

## Data stages

The Data Team adheres to the following guidance and timeline for different stages of data:

| Stage       |                                                                                                                                                                                                   Description |                                            Availability | De-identified / anonymized? |                                Archive branch |

## Data access

The Data Team follows the following guidance on data access if there is no explicit Data Use Agreement (DUA) in place:

| **nightly** | Data Team & Research Team | Generally disallowed. Consult with PI(s) if you really need access to nightly data |
