# Data Curation

The goal of the Data Team when archiving, sharing, and preserving data products (datasets and derived data products) is to reduce data uncertainty and serve specific designated communities including the source community. Datasets and derived data products are archived according to the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and the FAIR standards of scientific data management. They are shared in a way that protects and respects TIES survey respondents. 

Below are a list of general concepts followed by various standards for different kinds of datasets. The appendix has background material/definitions for common curation practices.

## General Concepts

### Data Uncertainty

This is the degree to which data is inaccurate, imprecise, untrusted, or unknown. All complex systems have a degree of uncertainty inherent within them. Practically this means that when designing data products, efforts should be made to reduce or remove missingness and ensure that data products are properly described with metadata/documentation where applicable.

### Desginated Community

This is the audience for a data product and can be an imagined group or persona. The term is borrowed from the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model and defined as “an identified group of potential Consumers who should be able to understand a particular set of information.” Each designated community has its own Knowledge Base. The Knowledge Base of a DC can change over time to the point where the archive would need to update and enhance preserved information to make it understandable again for the DC.

### Dataset and Derived Data Product

The dataset is the data that is to be preserved and shared. A derived data product is the analysis or aggregation of the dataset for reports, visualizations, or further analysis. Each dataset has a designated community that defines the linguistic and conceptual needs of the metadata and documentation. 

### Metadata

Metadata is the context, definitions, descriptions of the values in a dataset. This can include labels, study information, authorship, titles, funders, etc. 

### Open Science

TIES participates in open science where and when it doesn’t pose a risk to our sources. Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its dissemination acceptable to the public with limited to no restrictions. 

The Data Team's contributions to data processing, including code and packages, are open source, available to the public through Github, and we work to publish them in a appropriate repositories. For R packages, the appropriate repository is CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network).

We also follow FAIR principles, making certain that our datasets are accessible and our metadata is open. These datasets are anonymized/deidentified to protect the subjects. Where possible, we use multilingual information thesauri and controlled vocabularies to increase interoperability by the host countries of our studies. 

### Internationalization

According to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), internationalization is taking steps to develop content or applications in a way that will work for users from any culture, region, or language. Data Team standards state that we use internationalized and multilingual controlled vocabularies where and when feasible in our reuse datasets.
